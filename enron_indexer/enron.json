We\ninvite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon\non Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this\nevent.\n\nOur theme is \"2001: An Energy Odyssey.\" We are using the conference to\nshowcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to\ndeal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as\nenterprise strategy and metamorphosis.  We can think of no one better to\nclearly define these major themes and priorities than you.\n\nI was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in\nMontreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that\nthe regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points t=\no\nheart).  The thoughts you offered -- on the importance of standards, the\nopportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of\nvital importance to IAEE/USAEE members.  We would ask you to include\ncomments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both\nguiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in\nmarkets on behalf of enterprises.\n\nThe IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business an=\nd\nuniversity interests engaged in energy development and policy.  To bring yo=\nu\nup-to-date on the association, our Web site is www.iaee.org. I'm sure\nRosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together\nfor you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston conferenc=\ne\n(at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In\naddition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of\nRD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues\nand Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a\njoint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology\nConference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas.\n\nFinally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate\nsponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project,\nwhich you helped to found.  Thus, we also are relying on Rob Bradley to hel=\np\nidentify and implement the major environmental themes for the plenary\nsession, \"Sustaining Development\" (yes, we indeed are trying to turn\nthinking around with our re-phrasing).\n\nI hope to hear from Rosilea soon on your interest and availability.

Governor Knowles is the current \nchairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and it will be under the \nauspices of the IOCC.? They promise at least seven governors and a lot of \nother distinguished people.? It seems to us that this is a very timely event.\n\nThey would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker.? (I will be kicking \noff the conference).?? It looks to be a very good and high visibility \nplatform.? And they would be very keen and excited -- and honored -- to have \nyou in that featured role in it works for your schedule.\n\nIt takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. \n\nTony is a very good guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms very \nlarge for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill you in \nfurther on what they would like to accomplish.\n\nIf it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, \nthat would be great. \n\nOn behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration. \n\nBest, \n\nDan \n\n\n", "mid" : "29970419.1075840286080.JavaMail.evans@thyme", "fpath" : "enron_mail_20110402/maildir/lay-k/_sent/116.", "bcc" : [], "to" : [ "dyergin@cera.com" ], "replyto" : null, "ctype" : "text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968", "fname" : "116.", "date" : "2000-08-23 07:21:00-07:00", "folder" : "_sent", "subject" : "Re: Governors Conference" }

Walker professorship and keynote request\n\n\nThanks so much for your most generous gift to complete the funding for the\nprofessorship honoring Pinkney Walker.  I'm delighted that you plan to\nattend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.\n\nThe purpose of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient\nway of reaching you, is two-fold:\n\n     1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the Pinkney\nC. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.  Rather than designating the\nprofessorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for some\nother area, I'd like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in\nthe College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness.\nBoth Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call into\nHarold Hook to seek his input.\n\nA few points of elaboration:\n     * \"Distinguished\" is a standard adjective in the titles of such\npositions.\n     * We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within the\ncollege to select the recipient of the professorship, subject to my\napproval.\n     * And, I don't know if we will have the recipient selected by October\n13.\n\nThis name for the professorship (1) coincides with Pinkney's great strength,\n(2) allows me to avoid any \"turf battles\" (either within the college or with\nEconomics) and (3) underscores the great importance of teaching in the\ncollege.  Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name.\n\n     2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society\nbanquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief\ntalk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of\nbusiness.  Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive\nevent.  By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now\nlive in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have\nchosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program.\nYour talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed\n(probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship.\nI understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the\nmorning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable\nfor the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great latitude in\nchoosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know if you\nwill serve as the keynote speaker.\n\nIf you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete the\nplans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney\nWalker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.  Naturally, if\nyou have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.  My office # is\n573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972.\n\nLet me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not\nPinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been\nexperiencing some health problems.  However, the latest I've heard is that\nhe intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there.\nTime permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you'll\nsee him here in Columbia on October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his\nwife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I\nwill host that evening for members of the college's advisory board.  Of\ncourse, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it's\nmy understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.)\n\nKen, thanks very much.  I hope and trust that you had an ample dose of \"R&R\"\nduring your vacation.  I look forward to hearing from you.\n\n", "mid" : "32998721.1075840286219.JavaMail.evans@thyme", "fpath" : "enron_mail_20110402/maildir/lay-k/_sent/122.", "bcc" : [], "to" : [ "walker@missouri.edu" ], "replyto" : null, "ctype" : "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "fname" : "122.", "date" : "2000-09-08 07:02:00-07:00", "folder" : "_sent", "subject" : "Re: P.

We have already received \nconfirmation that President-elect Vicente Fox and Mexican Central Bank \nGovernor Guillermo Ortiz will participate. We are also expecting the presence \nof the future key cabinet members and state governors.\n\nAs usual, the World Economic Forum pulls together the right group of leaders \nto discuss issues, build a network of contacts and identify where future \nbusiness opportunities and risks lie. The Meeting will focus on four main \ntopics: the country's political and social agenda, Mexico's commercial \nrelationships with the rest of the world, the new economy and the key issues \nfor the country's main industries.\n\nPlease consult our website, http://www.weforum.org/mexico, where information \nwill be updated as soon as it becomes available.\n\nFor further information, please do not hesitate to contact Gisela Galicia at \n(41 22) 869 1450 or mailto:mexicomeeting@weforum.org\n(  ) Please send me more information on the conditions for participation.\n\n(  ) Please send information to:\n\n- Name:\n- Position:\n- Company:\n- Tel.:\n- Fax:\n- E-mail:\n\n( XX ) I am unable to participate in the Mexico Meeting 2000.\n\nPlease tick the appropriate response and return this form to Gisela Galicia \nby fax: (41 22) 786 2744 or via e-mail: mailto:mexicomeeting@weforum.org\nWe look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\n\n\n", "mid" : "5372290.1075840286288.JavaMail.evans@thyme", "fpath" : "enron_mail_20110402/maildir/lay-k/_sent/125.", "bcc" : [], "to" : [ "mexicomeeting@weforum.org" ], "replyto" : null, "ctype" : "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "fname" : "125.", "date" : "2000-09-08 12:08:00-07:00", "folder" : "_sent", "subject" : "Re: World Economic Forum - Mexico Meeting 2000" }

This is not a permanent \nexemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.\n\nMidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's \nreported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, \nKen Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.\n\nThe utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an \namendment to a \"must pass\" piece of legislation during the waning days of \nthis Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' \nstrategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes \ntax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as \ncontributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to \npaid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth \nEdison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. \n2944).\n\nSenator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA \namendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed \nto the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've \nreviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the \nconcept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was \nSenator Kerrey's idea.  \n\nIt is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) \nwould still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact \nthat Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the \nDemocrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not \nhe is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive \nelectricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is \"at least \nthree years away from happening.\"\n\nSteve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position \non this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to \noppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like \nSouthern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the \nMidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access \nprovisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support. \n\n\n\n\n", "mid" : "23248272.1075840286359.JavaMail.evans@thyme", "fpath" : "enron_mail_20110402/maildir/lay-k/_sent/128.", "bcc" : [ "steven.kean@enron.com", "richard.shapiro@enron.com", "james.steffes@enron.com", "joe.hillings@enron.com", "tom.briggs@enron.com", "joe.hartsoe@enron.com", "sarah.novosel@enron.com", "dwatkiss@bracepatt.com", "awenner@velaw.com" ], "to" : [ "cynthia.sandherr@enron.com" ], "replyto" : null, "ctype" : "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "fname" : "128.", "date" : "2000-09-10 23:23:00-07:00", "folder" : "_sent", "subject" : "Re: New PUHCA Exemption Legislative Language" }

We understand completely that the April 25 slot following\nhis return from vacation is not the most ideal arrangement.  I think it's\nalways easiest for someone like him if he knows that a speech given recently\ncan easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted to remind you of\nmy previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May to\nthe World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that, and we\nwould work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new\ncontent.

The Democrats and the\nRepublicans will have representatives at most of the\npolls, let them know if there is suspicious activity.\nFinally, if you have time, call your local offices and\noffer your time to make phone calls to encourage\npeople to get out and vote, pass out leaflets, or to\nbe available to help prevent of voter fraud.\n\nFinally, enjoy the evening and watch the results come\nin.

I wanted to make\nsure you were able to read it in its entirety.\n\nYou are a part of my e-Katz list because of your work with me or my\nadministration.  To be removed from the \"e-Katz\" distribution list, simply\nreply to this e-mail with your request.  If you have multiple e-mail\naddresses you use, please include a name and/or company, otherwise we may\nnot be able to locate the correct entry to remove.  For more information on\nthe Katz administration, visit our website at\nhttp://www.ci.portland.or.us/mayor.\n\n\nStatement Regarding Police Chief Mark Kroeker\n\n\"I take my responsibilities as police commissioner very seriously.  I have\nreviewed this situation with care.  I want to thank those who provided me\nfeedback either in person, over the telephone or through e-mail.\n\n\"The performance of any individual in my administration ultimately rests\nwith me.  I want to apologize for the concern, pain and fear caused by the\ntaped comments made years ago by Chief Kroeker.  His taped comments in no\nway reflect my own personal beliefs.\n\n\"My community and staff discussions, along with reading all the e-mails and\ntranscripts of all my telephone messages, helped distill my thinking on this\nissue to one key question: Can Chief Kroeker separate his personal religious\nviews from his professional conduct?\n\n\"I have determined that he manages his duties without bias and will continue\nto do so. His performance has met my expectations.  He is leading the bureau\nin a fair, respectful and inclusive manner.  He is moving our law\nenforcement efforts to a higher level of community policing.  Therefore, I\nhave asked Mark Kroeker to stay on as Chief of Police.  He has my strong\nsupport to continue.\n\n\"The law provides that all city employees have a right to their personal\nreligious views.  I have a responsibility to review their employment status\nif their actions, as a result of their personal views, impair their ability\nto perform their professional responsibilities.\n\n\"Many of the arguments raised asking me to dismiss Mark Kroeker because he\nis \"out of step with Portland\" could be used in other Oregon communities to\nfire more liberal public officials who are \"out of step\" with their\ncommunity's conservative majority.  My 30-year fight for tolerance goes both\nways.\n\n\"Chief Kroeker will have to rebuild trust with many of our citizens.   He\nassures me he is prepared to do so.  He told me he would rather help undo\nthe damage, help me promote tolerance and acceptance of all people, than\njust walk away.\n\n\"He commits to a strong and sustained positive dialogue with Portlanders who\nare gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, including those on his staff.\nHe has already begun outreach efforts and will continue to do so.\n\n\"He said he will redouble his efforts to promote respect and acceptance of\nall Portlanders and be steadfast and fair in his enforcement of the law.\n\n\"He agrees to work with the Cascade Aids Project to serve as a spokesperson\nto educate citizens about the fact that AIDS is not a \"gay disease.\"\n\n\"He will continue to seek advice from the City Council, the Bureau's Sexual\nMinority Roundtable and others to guide additional efforts.\n\n\"He agrees to take all this on with all his heart.\n\n\"In the process I hope he and we all learn from this experience.  I will\nwork to turn this negative situation into a positive one: to expand our\nsense of tolerance; to promote the notion that regardless of a person's\npersonal or religious beliefs, one can be an effective public servant; and\nto deepen the acceptance of all Portlanders.\n\n\"As Mayor, I will do my part and more.  I hope you will join me.\"\n\n\n\n", "mid" : "4072915.1075840287041.JavaMail.evans@thyme", "fpath" : "enron_mail_20110402/maildir/lay-k/_sent/157.", "bcc" : [], "to" : [ "mayorkatz@ci.portland.or.us" ], "replyto" : null, "ctype" : "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "fname" : "157.", "date" : "2000-11-09 20:31:00-08:00", "folder" : "_sent", "subject" : "Re: e-Katz: Chief Kroeker" }

We checked and there \nis no record of this problem reported recently (we checked back to May 2000) \non all three Falcon 900's.\n\nLyndel checked the system and there does seem to be a problem with it \ndisconnecting if you pick it up before the third ring.  After the third ring \nit works fine.  That is all I know at this time.  Garrett Av is coming over \ntoday to check the system.\n\nI know you don't like emails but I didn't want this it slip by.

The event as outlined below is scheduled for \nMarch 28th.  I appreciate your consideration.\n\nKevin\n\n----- Forwarded by Kevin Hannon/Enron Communications on 11/29/00 08:38 AM \n-----\n\n\tras22@cornell.edu\n\t11/29/00 06:19 AM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: Kevin Hannon/Enron Communications@Enron Communications\n\t\t cc: \n\t\t Subject: \n\nKevin-\n\n\nJust a quick follow-up on my November 2 email regarding Enron's\nparticipation in the Johnson School's March Leadership Week and the\npossibility of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had a\nchance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on\nyou plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. \nBelow is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all\nis well with you.\n\n\n            Nov.2 email text\n\n\nWe at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link\nwith Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the\nagile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable\nmarkets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like\nEnron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic\nOrganizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and\nbeyond.\n\n\nThe specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. \nFirst, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key\nspeaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As\ndescribed in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three\nconferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and\nstudents.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a \"live\ncase study\" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,\n2001</underline>.\n\n\nYou, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this\nis the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay\nand would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and\nthe Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the\ncorporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken\nChenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced\nPresident of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a\ndistinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in\ncontinually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  \n\n\nWe have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership\nWeek, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman\nSachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company\nand an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank\nRhodes, but these are still long shots.\n\n\nThe point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the\nJohnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted\na platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If\nthey can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the\ndate is March 28, 2001.       \n\n\nThe second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same\nlines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it\ncould become the basis for the March conference live case study\npresentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to\nliterally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage\nan organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place\nthat you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to\nbe the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and\npractices make this possible.\n\n\nI know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around\n1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational and\nleadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team to\nbuilding this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer\nfrom the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the\nEnron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast\nmoving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient\nway.\n\n\nKevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and\nhopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can to\nmake it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. \nPlease let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.  As\nalways, thanks for your great personal support.\n\n\nDick\n\n\n\n", "mid" : "22692423.1075840287367.JavaMail.evans@thyme", "fpath" : "enron_mail_20110402/maildir/lay-k/_sent/171.", "bcc" : [ "sherri.sera@enron.com", "carol.brown@enron.com" ], "to" : [ "kevin.hannon@enron.com" ], "replyto" : null, "ctype" : "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "fname" : "171.", "date" : "2000-12-11 06:39:00-08:00", "folder" : "_sent", "subject" : "Re: Cornell" }

Key Barriers to Distributed Generation\n\nExcessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges\n\nSolution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took=\n a=20\nstep in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been=20\ndesigned by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20\nmonopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t=\nhe=20\nelimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20\n1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for=\n=20\nCalifornia to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc=\ne=20\nthe risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by=20\noffering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o=\nf=20\ndistributed generation.\n=20\nExcessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20\ninvestor-owned and municipal utilities\n\nSolution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =\na=20\nstep in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20\ninterconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this=\n=20\nrequirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20\ngeneration.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=\n=20\ninterconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=\n=20\nthrough executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20\npossible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=\ne=20\nutility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20\naccomplished through amendments to SB 27X.\n\nPermitting and Air Quality Issues\nDevelopers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=\n or=20\ngreater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an=\nd=20\ntherefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20\ngeneration faces. =20\n\nSolution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru=\n=20\nD-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant=\n=20\noutput apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil=\nities.=20\nIn addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=\n=20\nface local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20\ninterests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=\n. =20\nThese objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.\n\n3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=\n=20\nElectricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20\n\nEnron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=\n=20\nsuppliers.\nEnron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=\ne=20\ngoal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.\nHowever, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=\n=20\nconcerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.\nWe understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=\nredit=20\nrisk concerns.\nEnron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=\n=20\nis working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=\n=20\nboth sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=\n=20\ngoing forward.\n\nSummary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue\n\nAmbiguous Ratemaking Authority\nThe language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20\ncharge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our=\n=20\nanalysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20\nCalifornia PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  =\nAs=20\nsuch, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=\nes=20\nadequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.\n\nAmbiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018\nThe language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=\n=20\nUtilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=\n=20\n=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=\nuse to=20\nallow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20\npurchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=\nee=20\nto include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=\n=20\nDWR has entered into with suppliers.\n=20\nAmbiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=\n=20\nRecover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases\nIn addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=\n=20\nnoted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=\n=20\nthe specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=\noy to=20\npermit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=\ns=20\nextremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=\nre=20\nDWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =\nis=20\ndifficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=\n=20\nrates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=\n=20\ncosts.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=\n=20\nsuppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=\n=20\nfrom ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.\n\nOptions to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20\n\nWe have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=\nsk=20\nissues.  We have identified three options:\n\nAmend AB1X\nThe amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=\n=20\nPUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=\nred by=20\nDWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =\nto=20\nensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the=\n=20\npreferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=\n=20\nchallenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20\nentitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)\n\nClarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20\nthrough Contract Language\nThis is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20\nimplement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=\nre=20\ntime to implement than the \"legislative\" fix.  We have attached electronic=\n=20\ncopies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=\n=20\nwould need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20\n=01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)\n\nMake Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk\nAs indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=\ncept=20\nother forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,=\n=20\ncash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have=\n=20\nindicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=\n=20\nprefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=\n=20\ncontract amendments.\n\n4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001\n\nBoth the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20\nAssociates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=\n=20\nshowing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=\nr=20\nonly on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=\nl=20\ncredible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=\n=20\nof 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20\nlikely. =20\n\nCEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20\nsummer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20\nestimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=\n well=20\nbelow the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=\nn=20\nin the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=\n=20\nthan other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20\nunpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=\no=20\ndate. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=\nhe=20\nflexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20\nCalifornia=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =\nthis=20\nrequirement. =20\n\nOther reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=\n=20\ndraw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=\nre=20\nsupply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=\n=20\nnumber of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20\nutilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=\nt=20\npace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=\n=20\nadded to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.\n\nCERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=\n=20\nrolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20\noptimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=\n=20\nMWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California=\n=20\nshould view the CEC's \"rosy scenario\" with considerable skepticism.\n\n5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=\n=01,s=20\nElectricity Crisis\n\nThis email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=\nl=20\ndeliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=\n=20\nbills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.\n\nAs we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20\ncrisis must focus on four issues:\n\nIncrease supply\nDecrease demand\nEstablish a truly competitive retail electricity market\nReturn California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency\n\nIncrease supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)\nTo site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =\n=20\nEnron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=\n=20\nthan a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.\n\nThe Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=\nslation=20\nare steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=\nse=20\nefforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=\n=20\nin securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20\nrequirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=\n=20\nproposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20\ntransfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20\ninnovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20\nemissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=\nir=20\ndistricts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20\nrequired reductions in pollution emissions.\n\nDecrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)\nBecause of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=\n=20\nthe supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=\n=20\nbest chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=\nst=20\neffectively and quickly in two ways:\n\nBuy-down demand\nCalifornia is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=\nd=20\nto finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=\n more=20\neconomically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=\nld=20\nbe willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=\n=20\nthrough the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20\ndetermine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20\nparticipate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20\nnecessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20\nreductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D=\neal=20\nBench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.\n\nUse Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment\nTo be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:\n\nAn internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=\n=20\nfor hour-ahead power in real time.=20\nReal-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=\n=20\nverification.\nSettlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be=\n=20\npaid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).\n\nThe potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=\ne:\n\n=01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti=\ncularly=20\nin the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation=\n=20\nresources.\nreduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20\nelectric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity =\nin=20\nthe state.\nfostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris=\nk=20\nof hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20\ncustomers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for=\n=20\nresponding.=20\n\nWe estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in=\n=20\nexcess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for=\n=20\nsummer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate=\n=20\nthat the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time=\ns=20\nthat amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20\ndirectly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20\ncontrol systems that would support load curtailment implementation.\n\nEstablish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi=\ncle:=20\nSB27X\nThe only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we=\nre=20\ncustomers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy=\n=20\nservice providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from=\n=20\ncustomers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th=\ne=20\nprohibition against Direct Access.\n\nEnron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a=\n=20\ndirect access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o=\nf=20\nWater Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from=\n=20\ncustomer migration. =20\n\nIn addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when=\n=20\nthe utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme=\nnt=20\nis not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20\ncondition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20\ntherefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20\nfunction entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20\nnon-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, Californ=\nia=20\nshould hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period =\nin=20\nwhich competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments=\n=20\nof utility load.\n\nReturn California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative =\nvehicle:=20\nAB18X\nUtility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand=\n. =20\nIn short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20\nimbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers=\n=20\nand businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ=\nia=20\nState government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend=\ned=20\nperiod of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc=\ne=20\nin California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20\nparticipate in that market.\n\nCalifornia can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a=\n=20\nseries of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate=20\nincreases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without=\n=20\n=01&shocking=018 the economy or household budgets For example, California c=\nould=20\namortize the recovery of the utilities=01, past debt over a 5-10 year perio=\nd. =20\nIn addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways:=\n=20\nFirst, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in=20\nrecognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of =\nAB=20\n1890.  Second, California can =01&net=018 the revenues the utilities have r=\neceived=20\nfrom selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav=\ne=20\naccrued due to the retail price cap.\n\n ", "mid" : "17889360.1075840295615.JavaMail.evans@thyme", "fpath" : "enron_mail_20110402/maildir/lay-k/_sent/174.", "bcc" : [], "to" : [ "jimbrulte@aol.com" ], "replyto" : null, "ctype" : "text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968", "fname" : "174.", "date" : "2001-02-16 10:07:00-08:00", "folder" : "_sent", "subject" : "Information from Ken Lay at Enron" }

You might \nremember that Ralph Hodge had indicated to you that you may well be hearing \nfrom the Ghanaian Ambassador.  Ralph believes that he will try to facilitate \na meeting between you and Chevron.\n\nWe have been working Ghana pretty hard, including the West African Gas \nPipeline, the Effasu Power Project, a marketing company and a host of other \npossibilities.  We have told the Ghanaians that with what is going on right \nnow in Nigeria, the loss of projects in Cote d'Ivoire due to the coup d'etat, \nand the lack of speed in moving forward in Ghana , that we are slowing down a \nbit to determine if we can resolve current projects before taking on \nadditional ones.  \n\nClearly this is a bit of a \"cop out\".  I am reluctant to tell Ghana that we \nare slowing down generally in Africa because I don't want to hurt the barge \ndeal or jepordize the possible resolution of the large snowball in Mozambique \nand there is truth to the Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria issues.  And, of course, \nI don't want to alienate Ghana generally.  I have a good relationship with \nthe Ambassador from Ghana, in fact, I just got a postcard from him two days \nago, and when he returns to the US he has indicated that he will call me.  I \nwill deliver this message, hopefully diverting the call to you.  If he does \nget to you first, he won't be upset for you to send him on to me, I don't \nbelieve.\n\nIf there is any clarification, please give me a holler.  I hope the office \nopening has gone well.  I've extracted many a promise from participants to \ndrink a pint for me.\n\nRegards\nRebecca\n\n", "mid" : "20311281.1075840283655.JavaMail.evans@thyme", "fpath" : "enron_mail_20110402/maildir/lay-k/_sent/19.", "bcc" : [], "to" : [ "rebecca.mcdonald@enron.com" ], "replyto" : null, "ctype" : "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "fname" : "19.", "date" : "2000-02-29 05:33:00-08:00", "folder" : "_sent", "subject" : "Re: Ghana" }
